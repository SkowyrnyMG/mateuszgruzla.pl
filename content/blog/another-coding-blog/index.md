## Who the heck am I?

My name is Matthew and I am a Front-end developer.

I can't definite on which level of skill I am currently (Entry, Junior, Regular), but I know that one year ago I couldn't even style a button correctly. Now creating design and coding my projects is just a regular day for me. Like I've mentioned on my about page, I just love to code and I want to learn new things every day to become a greater developer and person.

## Why I've made this blog?

I've decided to create this blog because I knew that it will be a great challenge for me. As you have probably noticed my writing English skills are not that great. I always was a better speaker than a writer - even in my national language. 

My coding experience is also not that great to call me an expert. Still, I am pretty sure that some of the issues and problems that I have already solved are causing to other people many stressful situations and problems. That's why I think even now someone can learn something useful from me.

And at last, I know that if I will write a post about something then I will go through every detail of the problem or technology. In simple words, I will learn how to solve many edge cases just by gathering the information for the article.

## What kind of content you can expect?

### Tutorials

For now, it won't be anything complicated. You can expect some animations tutorials with pure CSS or GSAP, some libraries tutorials, or just base introductions to some environments. In the future, I plan to do some more complicated stuff, but for now, I want to gain some more confidence as a writer.

### Interesting bugs and problems

If I will solve some tough bugs or problems during my coding sessions and I will not be able to find any useful info in one place in Google, then I will gather all of the pieces of information that I found and I'll put them in one place, so you won't have to do that by your own.

### Ready solutions

All the code that I am going to write will be placed in clear and understandable code blocks. I want to prepare ready to use solutions which you would copy and paste directly into your project!

### My coding diary

Trust me I have many app ideas that I would like to tackle in near future. All of them I find interesting in some kind of way. That's why sometimes for sure I will be just quickly resuming some of the progress that I've made within my private projects.

## Content frequency

Once a week/two weeks, it will depend on many aspects. Right now I have a full-time job as a transport administration manager, so I have only a few hours per day to learn something new or to code some projects. I will try to do my best and update as much quality content as I will be able to do. Maybe in near future, I will get a job as a Developer, which would help me to grow even faster and also together with that release more high valued content?  Who knows... :D
