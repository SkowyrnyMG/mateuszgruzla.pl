        I&apos;ve contributed to the <b>livesession SDK plugin</b>. I managed to figure out how to install and run their package on Angular apps. It is nothing big though, but
        whenever I think about it, it makes me proud. If you donâ€™t know what <b>livesession</b> is, then you have to visit their webpage. Their software will help you keep an eye
        out on your clients needs and interests.
