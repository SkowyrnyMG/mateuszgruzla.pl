        Since I was a young kid it was all about PC, playing games, fast typing, etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        It all started with my good old friend <b>Commodore C64</b>, which my dad bought for me and my older brother as a Christmas gift one year. Back then, I did not even think
        about coding, graphics or design. I always wanted to master every game that I took into my hands and yes, I know that it sounds like the story of 90% of nerdy guys born in
        the nineties. For me however, it was <b>the beginning</b> of a beautiful <b>passion</b> that was slowly evolving to finally push me to learn how to <b>code</b> and to think
        like a programmer.

      <Content title='First lines of code' fullWidth>
        In <b>June</b> 2019 I wrote my first lines of <b>CSS</b>, but that was not my first coding experience... Back in high school, I had an IT profile which included
        <b>programming</b> classes. I could learn some basics about algorithms, planning my development process and some basics of different coding languages.
        <br />
        <br />
        They were teaching us Turbo-Pascal, C++, and <b>Java</b>. Oh, yes. Good ol&apos; Java{' '}

        . I think that it was my first programming language that I felt comfortable with. I took many extra classes to learn more and more of it, but unfortunately for me, that
        same year I graduated. After I finished school I had to start working to earn a living. I&apos;ve spent about 5 years without coding to finally come back to restart my
        education in 2019th.

      <Content title='Road to Frontend'>
        In 2019 I saw the prototype of my brother&apos;s website. He made it for himself on one of the popular page builders. After that I have sworn to him that one day I will
        create a website that will make him proud of me. As a total newbie &apos;&apos;webmaster&apos;&apos; I First gave WordPress a try. Quickly I&apos;ve noticed that I have to
        follow theme options and that did not leave any room to be creative, so I‚Äôve decided to learn <strong>CSS and HTML</strong>. At this point, I already knew what I would like
        to become in the future, so I&apos;ve bought some courses on Udemy. Of course, after that, I hopped quickly into <strong>JavaScript</strong> with the second edition of the{' '}
        <b>Przeprogramowani.pl</b> course. That was a blast. I was learning something new each day. Thanks to the mentors of Przeprogramowani.pl I was always writing the highest
        quality of code that I could and also gained some coding confidence. Right now I know that I can code ANYTHING that I want if I invest my time and heart into it. In the
        meantime, I have attended a few Frontend meetups during which I&apos;ve learned more about development, Javascript, and its frameworks to finally choose
        <strong> React</strong> as my favorite. .. and here we are! Right now I am practicing React, <strong>Gatsby</strong> and vanilla JavaScript on my projects and sometimes on
        commercial orders.
