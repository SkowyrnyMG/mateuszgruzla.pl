        Since I was a young kid I was all about PC, playing games, fast typing, etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        It all started with my old good friend <b>Commodore C64</b>, which my dad bought for me and my older brother as a Christmas gift one year. Back then of course I did not
        even think about learning coding, graphics, etc. I was just enjoying myself and always I wanted to master every game that I took in my hands. Yes, I know that it sounds
        like a story of 90% nerdy guys born in the nineties, but for me, it was<b>the beginning</b> of a beautiful <b>passion</b> that was slowly evolving in me to finally push me
        to learn how to <b>code</b> and think like a programmer.

        In <b>June</b> 2019th I wrote my first lines of <b>CSS</b>, but that was not my first coding experience... Back in high school, I was on IT profile and besides other
        subjects I had also
        <b>programming</b> classes where I could learn some basics of algorithms, planning my development process, and basics of few coding languages.
        <br />
        <br />
        They were teaching us Turbo-Pascal, C++, and <b>Java</b>. Oh, yes. Good old&apos; Java{' '}

        . I think it was my first programming language in which I felt comfortable. I took many extra hours of classes to learn more and more of it, but unfortunately for me,
        I&apos;ve been graduated in the same year. After I finished school I had to start work to earn money for a living. I&apos;ve spent more or less 5 years without code to
        finally come back to it in 2019th.

      <Content title='Road to Frontend'>
        In 2019 after I saw the prototype of my brother&apos;s website which he made for himself on one of the popular page builders I have sworn to him that one day I will create
        the webpage that will make him proud of it. As a total newbie as &apos;&apos;webmaster&apos;&apos; firstly I gave WordPress a try, but I‚Äôve noticed quickly that I have to
        follow theme options and I did not have any space to be creative, so I‚Äôve decided to learn <strong>CSS and HTML</strong> - I&apos;ve bought some courses on Udemy. At this
        point, I&apos;ve already known what I would like to become in the future. Of course, after that, I hopped quickly into <strong>JavaScript</strong> with the second edition
        of the &apos;&apos;Przeprogramowani.pl&apos;&apos; course. That was a great time. I was learning something new each day. Thanks to the Przeprogramowani.pl mentors I was
        always writing the best quality code and also I&apos;ve gained some coding confidence. Right now I know that I can code ANYTHING that I want if I invest my time and heart
        into it. In meantime, I‚Äôve visited a few Frontend meetups on which I‚Äôve learned more about development, Javascript, and its frameworks to finally choose to
        <strong> React</strong> as my favorite. .. and here we are! Right now I am practicing React <strong>Gatsby</strong>, and JavaScript itself on my projects and sometimes on
        commercial orders.
