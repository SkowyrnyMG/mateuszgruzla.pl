        Since I was young kid I was all about PC, playing games, fast typing etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        It all started from my old good friend <b>Comodore C64</b>, which my dad bought for me and my older brother as christmas gift one year. Back then of course I did not even
        think about learning coding, graphics etc. I was just enjoing myself and allways I wanted to master every game that i took in my hands. Yes I know that it sounds like story
        of 90% nerdy guys born in ninety‚Äôs, but for me it was <b>beginning</b> of beautiful <b>passion</b> which was slowly evolving in me to finnaly replace most time spent on
        playing video games to learn and practise <b>coding</b>.

      <Content title='First lines of code' fullWidth>
        On <b>June 2019th</b> I wrote my first lines of <b>CSS</b>, but that was not my coding ‚Äúfirst touch‚Äù... Back in highschoool I was on IT profile and besides of others
        subjects I had also <b>programming</b> classes where i could learn some basics of alghoritms, planning my development process and basics of few coding languages.
        <br />
        <br />
        They were teaching us Turbo-Pascal, C++ and <b>Java</b>. Oh, yes. Good ol‚Äô Java{' '}

        . I think it was my first programming language in which i felt really comfortable. I took many extra hours classes to learn more of it, but unfortunately for me I‚Äôve been
        graduated in the same year. After I finished the school I had to start work and because of that I‚Äôve spend more or less 5 years without code to finnaly come back to it in
        2019th.

      <Content title='Road to Frontend'>
        In 2019 after I saw prototype of my brother website which he made for himself on one of popular page builders I have sworn to him that one day I will create his personal
        wepage that will make him be proud of it. As totally newbie as ‚Äúwebmaster‚Äù firstly i gave Wordpress a try, but I‚Äôve noticed really quickly that I have to follow theme
        options and I did not really have any space to be creative, so I‚Äôve decided to learn <strong>CSS and HTML</strong>. Of course after that i hopped reallly quickly into
        <strong> JavaScript</strong> with second edition of ‚ÄúPrzeprogramowani‚Äù course. In meantime I‚Äôve visited few Frontend meetups on which I‚Äôve learnt more about development,
        Javascript and it‚Äôs frameworks to finnaly choose <strong>React</strong> as my favorite. .. and here we are! Right now I am practising React, <strong>Gatsby</strong> and
        JavaScript itself on my presonal projects and sometimes on commercial orders.
