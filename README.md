## Mateusz Gru≈∫la - personal website and blog

Hello there! This is my personal website and blog.
Click [here](https://mateuszgruzla.pl/) to checkout this page live!

The main purpouse of creating this website was sharing with wider group of people my skills, projects and toughts.

Technologies used to create this project: GatsbyJS, React, StyledComponents, GSAP3, Netlify + NetlifyCMS
Forms are handled with Formik - not so complicated library, but I think it's enough to create decent validated forms.
For newsletter I've used MailChimp.

## Blog

Here you can find some simple front-end tutorials (I am still beginner, but I am pretty sure that I will be able to write many interesting articles), my latest progress or solved problems which I've met during coding my current projects.

To keep track of everything what I am currently doing you can sipmly join to the newsletter - don't worry, I will not spam your inbox, but for sure I will send some summary of my actions at the end of each month instead! :)

## END

THANK YOU for visiting and Enjoy! :D
